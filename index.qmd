__Learner Personas__ help instructors figure out who they're trying to help and communicate an understanding to each other and to learners. Each persona has a general background, relevant prior knowledge or experience, the learner's perception of their needs, and any special considerations. [^1]

A *novice* is someone who doesn't yet have a mental model of some field: as a result, they don't know what they don't know. Someone is *competent* if they know enough to perform routine tasks without heroic effort. Someone is an *expert* if they are able to solve common problems at a glance and harder or more unusual problems reliably.

_Any_ learning material (tutorial, case study, online training, or in-person workshop) should be designed for 1--3 specific personas. The personas above have been synthesized from ones created by Epiverse-TRACE staff for the field of infectious diseases and public health.
