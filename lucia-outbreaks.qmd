1.  Lucia is a Field Epidemiologist working at the Ministry of Health in Bolivia for almost 4 years. She is looking forward to learning how to Make rigorous conclusions from modelling and statistical inference outputs of Outbreak analytics R packages.

2.  She use R packages like `{tidyverse}`, `{ggplot2}`, and `{rmarkdown}` for data cleaning, plotting and reporting data for Outbreak response.

3.  She wants to learn how to interpret the statistical and mathematical outputs generated by infectious disease modelling R packages. For her, this is key to inform stakeholders and the general public.

4.  Lucia is a single mother; the one evening a week she spends practicing R is the only out-of-work time sheâ€™s able to take away from family responsibilities.

## Needs

- Lucia wants more time than a webinar to learn how to use new outbreak analytics R packages. 

- She wants refreshers of applied statistics and mathematics concepts. 

- She also wants clear guidelines for the interpretation of Outbreak analytics package outputs. 

- She also wants case-studies per disease type to identify how to translate her field experience intro practice.
