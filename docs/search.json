She is also responsible for teaching a short course on applied statistic and mathematics for infectious disease modeling to fifty second-year Master and PhD students every year. (Students complain that the department’s course do not provide the programming skills they need for current research in the field.)\nAnya runs several studies on different countries each year. She used to analyze the results with Stata and MATLAB, but is switching to R (which she taught herself during a sabbatical). She has never taken a programming course, and suffers from impostor syndrome in discussions about things like GitHub and R Markdown.\nAnya would like to learn more about time series analysis to support her research, and about tools like Git and R Markdown. She also wants guidance using R to teach her short course on infectious disease modeling, which currently uses a mixture of Excel, Stata, and Berkeley Madonna.\nAnya is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn’t want to look uninformed in front of her colleagues and students."
