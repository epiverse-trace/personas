1.  Juan is a data-savvy professional working at the Ministry of Health in Kenya for almost 2 years. He is looking forward to learning how to carefully use R packages to generate modelling and statistical inference outputs.

2.  Juan is a novice in epidemiological concepts given his engineering and statistics studies. He just started a Online courses in Epidemiology where he is having training in Epidemiology concepts. He visits package vignettes for his day-to-day work.

3.  Juan wants to learn how to choose the parameters of specialised R packages in a pragmatic way during health emergencies (outbreaks), without losing scientific rigour. Also, he wants to learn how to interpret the outputs of stats and maths modelling generated by these specialised R packages to inform Field epidemiologists. If possible, learn how to contribute to these R packages.

4.  Juan believes that time is money: every minute she spends learning something new has to pay off sooner rather than later. He is vision impaired and needs screen reader friendly material.

## Needs

- Juan needs where to look for outbreak concept refreshers constantly. 

- He also needs case-studies per disease type given his novice experience in the field. 

- He also needs to access webinars to give him a sense of where the field is going, and short, intensive online training for very specific topics.

- He would like ready-to-use lesson material he could reuse or remix to share or organize a local training with his colleagues.
