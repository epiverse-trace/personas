1.  Juan is a data-savvy professional working at the Ministry of Health in Kenya for almost 2 years. He is looking forward to learning how to carefully use R packages to generate modelling and statistical inference outputs.
2.  Juan is a novice in epidemiological concepts given his engineering and statistics studies. He just started a Online courses in Epidemiology where he is having training in Epidemiology concepts.
3.  Juan wants to learn how to choose the parameters of specialised R packages in a pragmatic way during health emergencies (outbreaks), without losing scientific rigour. Also, he wants to learn how to interpret the outputs of stats and maths modelling generated by these specialised R packages to inform Field epidemiologists. If possible, learn how to contribute to these R packages.
4.  Juan believes that time is money: every minute she spends learning something new has to pay off sooner rather than later.

## Needs
