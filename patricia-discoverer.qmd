1.  Patricia is a PhD student learning to do exploratory data analysis with R. She works with code at least half of her time, mainly using R for data cleaning and visualization. She is familiar with the Rstudio Graphical Interface.

## Needs

Patricia wants to translate theory to practice with R. She wants workshops (as an opportunity to meet people) and self-paced lessons (so that she can learn new things on her own). She has a complete set of cheatsheets taped up on her wall, but usually checks Stack Overflow before looking at reference manuals.
