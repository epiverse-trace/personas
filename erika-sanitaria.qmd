She solves most of her data analysis tasks using Excel.

4.  Erika can read English well, but sometimes struggles to keep up with spoken conversation that involves a lot of jargon. She needs English subtitles in video tutorials. 

## Needs

- Erika needs short overviews to orient her and introductory self-paced tutorials that include videos or animated GIFs showing exactly how to drive the tools, and that use datasets he can relate to.

- Erika needs more time than an in-person workshop or online training to use R packages in her day-to-day job. 

- She also needs the companion of a mentor or colleague during her learning process to help her when she get's stuck after minutes trying to solve an error message. 

- She also needs to know where to ask for questions and get solutions in a timely manner.
